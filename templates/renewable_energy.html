<!--    The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does not beat around-->
<!--    the bush. If we do not make haste with the renewable energy transition, there will be grave, irreversible-->
<!--    consequences. The war in Ukraine adds fuel to the discussion: not only is it beneficial for the climate to-->
<!--    promote consumption of energy from renewable sources: it turns out that the international reliance on fossil-->
<!--    fuels had great effects on geopolitics, with long-lasting consequences.</p>-->
<!--<p>All the more reason to make haste with the transition to a renewable energy based society. From a climate-->
<!--    perspective, it is only the question if a growth in renewable energy consumption is enough to slow the release-->
<!--    of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. After all, the production of energy is not the only factor that comes in-->
<!--    to play. Agriculture, land use and forestry have an effect as well (EPA, 2022).</p>-->
<p>Used datasets:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Renewable energy (world) (OECD, 2022)</li>
    <li>Primary energy supply (world) (OECD, 2022)</li>
    <li>Total greenhouse gas emissions (Our World in Data, 2022)</li>
</ul>
<p>What is analysed?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Renewable energy consumption of G20 between 1990-2019</li>
    <li>Total energy consumption of G20 between 1990-2019</li>
    <li>Change in fraction of renewable energy consumption of G20 between 1990-2019</li>
    <li>Countries with highest and lowest relative growth of renewable energy consumption against greenhouse gas emissions</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the assumptions?</p>
<ul>
    <li>For convenience Europe (As part of G20) is considered both as EU28 and EU27 (with or without UK)</li>
    <li>'Renewable energy' includes: Hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, tide, wave/n and derivatives from solid biofuels,
        biogasoline, biodiesels, other liquid biofuels, biogases and the renewable fraction of municipal waste (nuclear not included)</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the units of measurement?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Energy Consumption:	Mln toe (tonnes of oil equivalent)</li>
    <li>Greenhouse gas emissions: CO2eq (carbon dioxide gas equivalent)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<!--<p>In this analysis, the fraction of renewable energy consumption as part of the total energy consumption of the G20-->
<!--    countries will be plotted over time. The data of the following set will be used: Renewable energy from OECD-->
<!--    (OECD, 2022) and primary energy supply (OECD, 2022). After the fraction of renewable energy consumption over-->
<!--    time has been established, the change in relative renewable energy consumption of the G20 countries between 1990-->
<!--    and 2019 will be plotted in a bar chart against the increase in emission of greenhouse gasses.</p>-->

<h4>Conclusion and discussion:</h4>
<p>A relative increase in renewable energy consumption does indeed lead to less emission of greenhouse gasses.</p>
<p> We are talking of course about G20 countries, so the argument that the diversity of
    available energy sources in countries at the lower end of the renewable energy consumption ranking are slim does
    not uphold. These are rich countries with a lot of resources at their disposal. Questions arise about
    scalability of renewable sources over the last decades. For example, China's explosive rise in demand is
    apparently not met by a renewable energy industry that is as scalable as the fossil fuel industry. Is it then a
    question of not enough willpower? Or are the rising demands of the new Chinese middle class no match for the
    stalling development of renewable energy technologies?</p>
<p>Arguably, Western countries e.g. UK, Europe as a whole, and USA had already undergone the economic boom that
    characterizes the other members, which puts them in a better position to diversify their energy sources as opposed
    to upcoming economies,
    since they do not have to meet demands of a new middle class.</p>
<p>In general it can be said that a relative increase in renewable energy consumption goes hand in hand with a
    decrease in greenhouse gas emission. The reason for this phenomenon arguably lies in e.g. willpower and a lack
    of scalability of the renewable energy supply.<hr></p>
